          I’m David, the founder and editor of this site, and the founder of
          Davtek. My background is in software development and automation, and
          over the years I’ve developed a deep passion for exploring how
          technology shapes the way we work, create, and live. This site started
          as a personal project. A way to document what I was learning and share
          those insights with a wider audience, and to be a resource for anyone
          who wants to stay ahead in the tech world.

          everything from the latest AI breakthroughs and software development
          trends to handy tools that can make your digital life more efficient.
